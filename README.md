# Social Network Application

This repository contains my project for the _Advanced Methods of Programming_ course.

The project resembles a small social network application which allows **authentication**, **messaging** or **friend requests** between **users**.

## Technologies used

- **Java**: _code_ in which the application was written.
- **JavaFX, FXML, CSS**: _interactive GUI_, with a splash of design.
- **PostgreSQL, BCrypt**: _data storage_ and _password encryption_.
