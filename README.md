# Social Network Application

This repository contains my project for the Advanced Methods of Programming course.

The project resembles a small social network application which allows authentication, messaging or friend requests between users.

## Technologies used

- Java: code in which the application was written.
- JavaFX, FXML, CSS: interactive GUI, with a splash of design.
- PostgreSQL, BCrypt: data storage and password encryption.
